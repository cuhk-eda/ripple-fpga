# RippleFPGA

RippleFPGA is a simultaneous pack-and-place algorithm for FPGA developed by the research team supervised by Prof. Evangeline F. Y. Young in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
It produces legalized placement solutions by effectively packing and placing the input netlist on the modern Xilinx FPGA architecture. 
It directly minimizes the routed wirelength generated by the commercial router.

### Features
* Target at modern commercial FPGA architecture (Xilinx UltraScale XU095)
* Support large-scale circuits
* Pack and place simultaneously with an analytical global placement engine (Ripple)
* Optimize both wirelength and routing congestion
* Results verified by Xilinx Vivado® Design Suite
* ...

## 1. How to Build

**Step 1:** Download the source codes. For example,
~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cuhk-eda/ripple-fpga
~~~

**Step 2:** Go to the project root and build by
~~~bash
$ cd ripple-fpga/src
$ make mode=release_mt
~~~

Note that this will generate a folder `bin` under the root, which contains binaries and auxiliary files.
More details are in [`Makefile`](src/Makefile).

### Dependencies

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (version 4.8.0) or other working c++ compliers
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (version >= 1.58)

## 2. How to Run

### Toy Test

Go to the `bin` directory and run binary `placer` with a toy design:
~~~bash
$ cd bin
$ ./placer -aux toy_example/design.aux -out toy_example.out
~~~

### Batch Test

Our placer uses the bookshelf format and has been tested on two contest benchmark suites [ISPD'16 Contest](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/16/) and [ISPD'17 Contest](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/17/), which can be downloaded via Dropbox ([ISPD'16](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9c74a6f4o0rrd2t/AAA3V_fiP15pV20fV62apLoqa), [ISPD'17](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9aranna360wnez2/AABYc5n1Sak3AY3m25eJ7Nyka)).
After downloading the benchmarks and putting them under folder `BM_DIR`, you can use our script `run.sh`:
~~~bash
$ cd bin
$ export BENCHMARK_PATH=BM_DIR
$ ./run all
~~~

## 3. Modules

## 4. Results
All the experiments were performed on a 64-bit Linux workstation with Intel Xeon 3.7GHz CPU and 16GB memory.
The placer is run in 2 threads and routed wirelength is reported by Xilinx Vivado® Design Suite with [patches provided by the ISPD contest orgranizers](https://github.com/ispd2016contest/vivado_patches).
